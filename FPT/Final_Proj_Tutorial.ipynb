    "The Rating column is the average user rating for the app between 1 and 5, with some outliers that must be dropped due to bad data that doesn't fit within these bounds. This value is a float. \n",
    "The Reviews column is the number of user reviews for the app. This value is an integer.\n",

    "The Content Rating column is a string determining which group the app is developed for. We had to break these columns down into fewer categories with only a few unique values to be able to analyze the data. The categories we chose were \"Everyone\", \"Teen\", and \"Adult\".\n",
    "The Genres Column is a succinct, general category for the app's content. Most apps fit into one of the multiple major categories but there are also a number of apps with more specific categories. For these apps, we placed them in one of the major categories by scanning for keywords that would give clues to their categorical placement. We formatted this column as strings. \n",
