    "The table we are scraping from has 13 columns which need to be processed differently and can be reduced and cleaned to a more manageable format. \n",

    "The Category column is the general category of the app and must be interpreted as a String. Many of the apps will have the same category value. \n",

    "The Reviews column is the number of user reviews for the app. This value is an integer.\n",

    "The Size column is the size of the app, how much space it takes up on a device. This value contains units of Megabite and other sizes and we have standardized these values to an integer value so they can be understood in context of each other. We drop the value 'Varies with size' due to its ambigiuity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Installs column is the number of devices that have installed the app. The raw data gives units in minimum possible values so we interpreted these minimum values into integer values. \n",

    "The Type column is whether it is a free app or not. This is a string value that we will interpret as a boolean value with True for Free and False for Not Free.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Content Rating column is a string determining which group the app is developed for. We had to break these columns down into fewer categories with only a few unique values to be able to analyze the data. The categories we chose were \"Everyone\", \"Teen\", and \"Adult\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The Genres Column is a succinct, general category for the app's content. Most apps fit into one of the multiple major categories but there are also a number of apps with more specific categories. For these apps, we placed them in one of the major categories by scanning for keywords that would give clues to their categorical placement. We formatted this column as strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Last Updated Column contains date information for when the app was last updated. We cleaned this data by parsing it using the datetime library so it was easier to sort through.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Current Ver Column is a string detailing the current version of the app available on the Play Store at the time of scraping. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Android Ver Column is a string detailing the minimum required version of the app to work on an android device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, the scraper of the dataset included that the row for \"Life Made WI-Fi Touchscreen Photo Frame\" was formatted incorrectly so we made the choice to drop that entry, other incorrectly formatted entries, and entries with NaN in a column before cleaning. "
