We drop the value 'Varies with size' due to its ambigiuity. \n",

    "\n",
    "The Genres Column is a succinct, general category for the app's content. Most apps fit into one of the multiple major categories but there are also a number of apps with more specific categories. For these apps, we placed them in one of the major categories by scanning for keywords that would give clues to their categorical placement. We formatted this column as strings. \n",

    "The Last Updated Column contains date information for when the app was last updated. We cleaned this data by parsing it using the datetime library so it was easier to sort through.\n",
