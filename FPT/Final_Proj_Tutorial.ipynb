    "The table we are scraping from has 13 columns which need to be processed differently and can be reduced and cleaned to a more manageable format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The App column is the name of the app and must be interpreted as a String. The names should all be unique. We will be dropping duplicate app names and keeping the apps that have more reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Category column is the general category of the app and must be interpreted as a String. Many of the apps will have the same category value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Rating column is the average user rating for the app between 1 and 5, with some outliers that must be dropped due to bad data that doesn't fit within these bounds. This value is a float. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Reviews column is the number of user reviews for the app. This value is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Size column is the size of the app, how much space it takes up on a device. This value contains units of Megabite and other sizes and we have standardized these values to an integer value so they can be understood in context of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Installs column is the number of devices that have installed the app. The raw data gives units in minimum possible values so we interpreted these minimum values into integer values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Type column is whether it is a free app or not. This is a string value that we will interpret as a boolean value with True for Free and False for Not Free.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Price column is the price of the app. Once we remove the dollar sign from the price of some of these values, this is interpreted as a float value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Content Rating column is a string determining which group the app is developed for. We had to break these columns down into fewer categories with only a few unique values to be able to analyze the data. The categories we chose were \"Everyone\", \"Teen\", and \"Adult\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The Genres Column is a succinct, general category for the app's content. Most apps fit into one of the multiple major categories but there are also a number of apps with more specific categories. For these apps, we placed them in one of the major categories by scanning for keywords that would give clues to their categorical placement. We formatted this column as strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Last Updated Column contains date information for when the app was last updated. We cleaned this data by parsing it using the datetime library so it was easier to sort through.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Current Ver Column is a string detailing the current version of the app available on the Play Store at the time of scraping. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Andriod Ver Column is a string detailing the minimum required version of the app to work on an android device.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, the scraper of the dataset included that the row for \"Life Made WI-Fi Touchscreen Photo Frame\" was formatted incorrectly so we had to individually format that row and switch the values to the correct columns before cleaning the data."
