Imported Numpy
Dataframe originally read from archive file? Changed it to simply the csv file for now.

Cleaned the rest of the dataframe except for the genres column 
Might have submitted the Jupyter in a weird way, trying to fix that on the submit for 12/12 
12/12
Formatted everything to make it a bit more organized.
Added introduction. Separated data collection into it's own code block and also gave it a blurb.
Based my writing off the examples in the syllabus. Prose makes up a good amount of our grade so lmk what you think.
We can change it if our project develops as we look more into data.

I've left Data Processing as it is for now. I think splitting up the huge blocks for column may be easier on the eyes.
Also I understand why genre and content rating are split like they are, but I'm worried Teli may expect a "Tidy" dataset for that part.
I can do some of this stuff myself, just wanted your opinion before I messed with what you have.

Graphing was a lot harder than I thought it would be. There are a few directions we could go.
Explained more in the notebook.
